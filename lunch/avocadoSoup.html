like eating a proper meal as it would be too hot and too heavy? This Avocado soup recipe is
a perfect option for such a day as it is a light meal option and you can eat it chilled which
will help to refresh yourself.<br><br>We have adjusted the recipe a bit to our liking, the original recipe came from the <a href ="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/marcela-valladolid/chilled- avocado-soup-recipe-1921060"> Food Network</a></p>

      <br>

  	  <p>To accompany the soup, we added roasted chickpeas, cashews and some crème fraiche. We
also prepared pitta bread chips sprinkled with Paprika to dip in the soup.<br><br><strong>Chickpeas:</strong><br><br>
Cover a baking tray with precooked chickpeas and add salt, pepper and paprika powder. Put
them in the oven at about 200 degrees Celsius and let them roast until they become
crunchy.<br><br><strong>Pitta Chips:</strong><br><br>Cut pitta breads into triangles and separate the two layers. Cover up a baking tray with the
pitta chips and cover with oil, salt, pepper and paprika powder. Put them in the oven at
about 175 degrees Celsius until they become a little bit brown and crunchy. For a healthier
option, use full wheat pitta bread.
