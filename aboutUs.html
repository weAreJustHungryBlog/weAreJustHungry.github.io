  <p class="subtitle">Two friends met in Barcelona with a unique love for food...</p><br><p class="contentText">We soon started to figure out that there are many &lsquo;cute places&rsquo; in Barcelona with amazing food and somehow made it our mission to explore these. We&#39;ve also both always loved to cook and bake and throughout our last two years of school we figured out what a great procrastination method that was. After finishing school, Julia stayed in Barcelona and Fenita went to London which made it possible for us to explore even more new places. Our love for food extends our excitement for travelling as it opens up the opportunity to explore many new places.<br>We created our blog &lsquo;we are just hungry&rsquo; to share the many amazing restaurants we have come along but also the many recipes we have tried out.</p>
