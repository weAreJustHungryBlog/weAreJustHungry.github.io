  	  <h1>Mojito Cheesecake</h1>

      <br>

   	  <p>Living in Spain implies getting through very hot summer days. What better way of doing this
than to combine one of our favourite drinks with cheesecake. This Mojito Cheesecake
Recipe is a perfect dessert for a hot summer day or even for a great sweet snack to share
with friends.<br> The following recipe has been adjusted from a recipe that we had found online. We
increased the amounts of cheesecake base in order for the cake to be bigger.</p>
